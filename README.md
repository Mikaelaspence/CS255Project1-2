Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass has recognized that many people fail their driver’s tests. They want to provide training in this regard including online courses, practice tests,
and on-the-road training opportunities for their customers. The system will need to include online accessibility, have different levels of access, a reservation 
system for different in-person driving lessons that includes assigning a driver, a means to store sensitive customer information, DMV connectivity, and a 
specific user interface.  

What did you do particularly well?

I felt as though I did a decent job with my different UML diagrams. I made a use case diagrams, activity diagrams, sequence diagrams and a class diagram. I feel like 
this gave me good practice in determining what each type of diagram is used for and how they represent a system differently.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could revise one part it would be in project one. I had a difficult time determining what was a functional vs nonfunctional requirement. It was a concept that 
took me a bit to grasp and I mixed up a few in my project one submission. I would arrange my requirements more appropriately if I could redo it. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I used the initial interview where requirements were gathered to determine the user's needs. I then sorted those into functional and nonfunctional requirements, keeping 
mind the constraints and limitations of the project. If you do not consider the user's needs when determining requirements or designing a system, you are likely to end up 
with a product that no one wants to use. If it doesn't meet their needs, why would they not look elsewhere? In the future I am likely to use a lot of what I 
learned in these projects. Gathering requirements and prioritizing them to design a system is very important. Also, the different UML diagrams are helpful in organizing 
information and being able to present it in a way that clients and stakeholders can understand, as well as others working directly on the project.
